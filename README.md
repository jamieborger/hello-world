# hello-world

Hi, I’m Jamie—a UI Designer who was formerly a commercial interior designer. My 20 years of professional experience in interior design has taught me how to read people and understand client’s needs through research and communication. It has also enabled me to learn about different facets of design that cross over to UI design, such as spatial awareness and color theory. I have learned that all of these elements combined help to generate good design—and the key to great design is to understand what the user wants.
This is a short bio about me.
